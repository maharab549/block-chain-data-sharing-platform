Blockchain-based Secure Data Sharing Platform
A decentralized platform for secure data sharing using blockchain technology and IPFS.

Overview
This platform ensures privacy, data integrity, and decentralized access control by integrating:

Blockchain for immutable transaction logging

IPFS for distributed file storage

A command-line interface (CLI) for user interaction

Key Features
Decentralized storage using IPFS

Immutable transaction history on the blockchain

Role-based access control

Data integrity verification

Simple command-line interface

Prerequisites
Python 3.7 or higher

IPFS installed and running (ipfs daemon)

Installation
1. Install IPFS
Download from: https://docs.ipfs.tech/install/

Initialize IPFS:

bash
Copy
Edit
ipfs init
Start the IPFS daemon:

bash
Copy
Edit
ipfs daemon
2. Install Python Dependencies
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Basic Commands
Task	Command
Check blockchain status	python cli.py status
Upload a file	python cli.py upload document.pdf --owner Alice
Mine a block	python cli.py mine
Grant access to a user	python cli.py grant <file_hash> --owner Alice --recipient Bob
Request/download a file	python cli.py request <file_hash> --recipient Bob

Example Workflow
Start the IPFS daemon:

bash
Copy
Edit
ipfs daemon
Upload a file:

bash
Copy
Edit
python cli.py upload test.txt --owner Alice
Mine a block:

bash
Copy
Edit
python cli.py mine
Grant access to Bob:

bash
Copy
Edit
python cli.py grant <file_hash_from_step_2> --owner Alice --recipient Bob
Mine another block:

bash
Copy
Edit
python cli.py mine
Bob requests the file:

bash
Copy
Edit
python cli.py request <file_hash> --recipient Bob
